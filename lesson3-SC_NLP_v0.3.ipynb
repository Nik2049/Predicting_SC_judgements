RAMANA, J.1.Aggrieved by the judgment and order, dated 4th October, 2006,passed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmadabad inCriminal Appeal No. 833 of 1997 and Crl.M.A. No. 1121 of1998 in Crl.A. No. 833 of 1997, the appellant is before thisCourt.2.The facts of the case in a nutshell as presented by theprosecution, are that the appellant herein and Mahendrabhai(deceased) had love marriage in the year 1981 and they wereblessed with two daughters. The deceased was running healthclubs in the city of Ahmedabad in the name and style of P.M.Health Club at two different locations; one at Naranpura and2the other at Ambawadi.  Accused No.1 i.e. Kishore Thakkarwas employed by the deceased to work at Naranpura location.With passage of time, the appellant (A2) developedextramarital relationship with Kishore Thakkar (A1) and inconsequence of their pursuit, they planned together toeliminate Mahendrabhai (deceased). In that context, on12.12.1994, when the complainant’s wife contacted theappellant at about 10:30 AM, appellant informed her that thedeceased had gone to Naranpura Health Club. Further, whencomplainant enquired about the deceased at 3:00 PM,appellant is alleged to have replied that the deceased left forBombay. Hearing this, complainant became suspicious aboutthe way his sister replied.  The complainant along with hiswife, at about 4 pm on that day, visited the house of theappellant and asked her to go and get her elder child backfrom the school. After she went out of the house hesitatingly,he searched the house and found his brother-in-law lying deadin a pool of blood in the bathroom and A1 was present there.As soon as he tried to catch hold of A1, he ran away from thespot half naked by pushing him.  While that is so, theappellant who went to bring back her elder child from theschool, did not return to her home.33. Basing on the complaint of the brother-in-law of the deceased,police registered Crime No. I.C.R. 759 of 1994 under Section302 read with Sections 120B and 201 of Indian Penal Code,1860 [hereinafter ‘I.P.C’ for brevity].  After conductingpanchnama at the scene of offence, body of the deceased wassent for postmortem. Carrying on investigation of the crime,police nabbed and arrested both the accused on 23.01.1995from S.T. Bus Station, Mehsana. After that, they collectedevidences from various places where both the accused hadspent their days together after the date of occurrence untiltheir arrest.  Upon filing of charge sheet by the police, the trialcourt took cognizance of the offence and framed charges.Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4.The trial court framed the following charges for trial:“(1)    On 12-12-1994 before about six o’clock in the evening you all accusedtogether with one another abscondingaccused who has not been arrested, namely,Piyush Sevantilal Raval hatched a criminalconspiracy to commit murder of thedeceased Mahendrabhai at House No.1,Shakuntal Apartment, Opp: C.N.Vidhyalayasituated in Navrangpura area, inAhmedabad and by doing so you committedan offence under Sec. 120(B) of Indian PenalCode within the jurisdiction of this Court.4 (2)Further more, on the aforesaiddate, time and at the aforesaid place, withregard to complete your criminalconspiracy, accused No.1 and theabsconding accused Piyush by inflictingnumerous blows by knife on the body of thedeceased Mahendrabhai Gadda, causinggrievous injuries intentionally caused hisdeath by committing murder and by doingso you accused have committed the offenceU/s.302 r/w sec.120(B) of the Indian PenalCode within the jurisdiction of this Court.(3)Further, on the aforesaid date,time and place, pursuance to your aforesaidcriminal conspiracy, you accused, byshifting the dead body of the deceased andby cleaning the place of offence destroyedthe evidence with an intention to getfreedom from the imprisonment of theoffence of murder and thereby you accusedhave committed the offence punishableu/S.201 of the Indian Penal Code within thejurisdiction of this Court. (4)Further, on the aforesaid date,time and place, pursuant to your criminalconspiracy, to make pieces of the dead body,committed an attempt to destroy theevidence by collecting a needle, jute-thread,plastic bag, iron blade etc., with anintention to destroy the evidence and to seethat no evidence regarding the identity ofthe dead body as also regarding the injuriescaused to Mahendrabhai Gadda is available,and by doing so you have committed anoffence punishable U/s. 201 r/w sec. 511 ofthe Indian Penal Code within thejurisdiction of this Court. (5)Further, on the aforesaid date,time and place, you accused No.1 bypossessing a deadly weapon like knife with5you, committed a breach of Public Notice ofProhibition of Arms published by the PoliceCommissioner, Ahmedabad City and bydoing so you have committed the offencepunishable U/s.135(1) of the Bombay PoliceAct, within the jurisdiction of this Court.”5.The trial court, after full-fledged trial, came to theconclusion that A1 has committed offences punishable underSections 302 and 201 of I.P.C. and Section 135(1) of BombayPolice Act and convicted him to undergo life imprisonment forthe offences punishable under Section 302 of I.P.C., in defaultto suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 months, and for theoffence punishable under Section 201 of I.P.C. sentenced himto undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and imposedfine of Rs.5,000/-, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonmentfor three months.  Appellant herein, who was convicted for theoffence punishable under Section 201 of I.P.C alone, wassentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 2 years andimposed fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in default to further sufferrigorous imprisonment for 3 months. 6.Both the accused, being dissatisfied with the judgment ofthe trial court, approached the High Court by way of separatecriminal appeals. The High Court, upon considering the factsand circumstances of the case, initiated suo motu proceedings6for enhancement of sentence in respect of accusedNo.2/appellant herein. The High Court while rejecting theappeals preferred by the accused, passed an order in thecriminal miscellaneous application enhancing the sentenceimposed by the trial court in respect of accusedNo.2/appellant herein for the offence punishable underSection 201 of I.P.C to rigorous imprisonment for seven yearsand imposed fine of Rs.7,000/- failing which she had tofurther suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years.   Assailingthe same, the appellant is before this Court by way of thisappeal. 7.Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel appearing for theappellant, vehemently contended that the Courts below havecommitted serious error in appreciating the evidences againstthe appellant and wrongly convicted her under Section 201 ofI.P.C, disregarding numerous vital portions of her statements.The appellant/accused No. 2 had never been part of the crimeand the reason behind her keeping silence when accused No. 1made entry into her house and committed the heinous crimeof brutally murdering her husband was that as a matter offact, on the fateful day at the time of occurrence, the appellantwas sleeping with her children. Accused No. 1 subjected her to7remain under great fear that if she raises any alarm, herchildren may also be assaulted by the intruder, which droveher to be a silent spectator to the incident. 8.It is further contended that after the occurrence, theappellant has not eloped with accused No.1 willfully but bytaking advantage of their relationship, accused No. 1 hasforcefully taken her to various places and kept her underfictitious names. It is also worthwhile to point that theappellant remained silent during her stay with accused No. 1after the incident because of her apprehension that police andfamily members would first of all find fault with her due to herillicit relationship with the main accused. Even during theperiod when the appellant was held hostage by accused No. 1at various places till their arrest, she could not get access toseek help of anyone mainly because, whenever the mainaccused went out of the room, he used to keep the appellantlocked inside. This fact is evident from the deposition of PW19(Ext. 72).  Her behavior at that moment was quite natural andshe had not played any role to destroy the evidence, but theCourts below did not appreciate the same in true legalperspective before convicting her under Section 201 IPC.8Taking a dig at the order of Courts below, learned seniorcounsel submitted that the appellant at any rate could nothave been held guilty for the offence merely basing upon thecircumstantial evidence i.e. needle, jute thread, plastic bag,iron blade etc., were found in the house of appellantconnecting her to the crime and attributing role by way ofaiding the main offender.9.Advancing another fervent argument that the High Courtpassed the impugned order in a mechanical way withoutapplication of legal principles to the case of appellant, learnedsenior counsel invited our attention to Ext. 4 to show that theappellant was in fact charged for the offence under Section201 r/w Section 511 of I.P.C. In that situation, if the appellantis, per se, convicted for the offence, she would have beenawarded the maximum quantum of sentence which comes upto three years and six months only.   Placing reliance on adecision of this Court in Ananda Dagadu Jadhav & Ors. Vs.Rukminibai Anand Jadhav & Anr. (1993) Supp. (3) SCC 68,learned senior counsel made a strenuous attempt that the trialcourt after considering this aspect by tangible legal principletook a right view and accordingly imposed sentence. Even ifthis Court finds the appellant guilty of the offence, the9impugned order passed by the High Court should be set asiderestoring that of the trial court.10.Learned counsel for the State of Gujarat, however, supportedthe judgment of the High Court and submitted that the HighCourt has rendered the impugned judgment following justprinciples of law and taking into account the veracity ofoffence committed by the appellant, the sentence has beenreasonably enhanced and the same does not call forinterference by this Court.11.Having heard the learned counsel for both sides andbestowing attention to the voluminous material placed beforethis Court, following issues fall for consideration of this Court:1)Whether the Courts below were right in convicting theappellant under Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code?2)Whether the High Court was right in suo motuenhancing the sentence from two years to seven years?12.I have given my anxious consideration to several aspectsinvolved in the case. The entire case of the prosecution restsupon circumstantial evidence except for the direct evidence ofAmi, who is the daughter of the deceased and the appellant. Itis well settled that circumstantial evidence should be strong,10convincing and unassailable leading to the only inference thatcrime should have been committed by the accused only and itshould not give any other inference. 13.A thorough look at the facts of the case put forth by theprosecution reveals that accused Nos.1 and 2 are living in anillicit relationship and in pursuit of the same, they havecommitted the murder of the deceased and the complainant isnone other than the brother of appellant and brother-in-law ofthe deceased.  14.Prosecution, to bring home the guilt of the accused, hasexamined 48 witnesses in addition to voluminousdocumentary evidence.  After a full-fledged trial, the trial courthas come to the conclusion that accused No.1 with the help ofthe absconding accused has committed the murder of thedeceased and held him guilty for the offence punishable underSec.302 of I.P.C.   As far as accused No.2/appellant isconcerned, the Court has observed that there is no evidenceavailable to show that she is a consenting party or she had aprevious meeting of mind with accused No.1 to murder thedeceased and as such accused No.2 is not guilty for theoffence of murder and for the acts done by accused No.1 of11committing the murder of the deceased.  The trial courtfurther observed that her silence is due to fear and being in ahelpless condition and with an apprehension that her childrenand herself might be injured by accused No.1 and abscondingaccused.  It is quite natural that accused No.2 could not haveasked for help.  But the trial court opined that up to 1.00 or2.00 p.m., accused No.1 was away from the place of offenceand during that time, she could have got the help.  15.The trial court further observed that her subsequentconduct can be attributed for her consent or abetment of theoffence of destroying the proof of murder.  Cutting instrument,its blades, plastic yellow color tags and other articles found atthe place of offence and second part of the plastic yellow tagfound from the house of relative of accused No.1 would go toshow that the preparation for destroying the proof of murderwas planned by accused No.1 and accused No.2 by remainingsilent.  Still the Court felt that she is not a conspirator butafter 7.30 a.m. on 12-12-1994, she allowed accused No.2 toenter into her house again and remain with the dead body inthe bathroom of the bedroom.  That act shows that either outof fear or for reasons best known to her, she abetted or aidedthe offence punishable under Section 201 I.P.C.  Regarding12disappearance of the evidence of offence, it is further observedby the trial court that though there is no evidence ofparticipation of accused No.2 in causing disappearance of thesaid proof of offence of murder but by remaining silent, sheabetted the offence of causing disappearance of evidence ofmurder and as such convicted both the accused for the offenceunder Section 201 I.P.C. 16.The High Court while hearing the appeals as well as themiscellaneous petition for the suo motu enhancement ofsentence, has categorically observed that accused No.1 mighthave entered into the house of the deceased with the consentof A2.  Further, she gave all false replies to the complainantand his wife.   The High Court observed that when accusedNo.1 was not present in the house for 6 to 7 hours, at leastshe should have informed anyone about the incident.  Allthese clearly involve her actively in the crime along withaccused No.1.  The evidence also establishes that accusedNo.2 permitted accused No.1 to enter into the house andallowed him to keep other articles.  All the above actsdemonstrate her active involvement in the crime in questionindicating that conspiracy has been established byprosecution, but as no appeal is filed by the State, the High13Court has not dealt with the issue.   The High Court finallyheld that by way of cogent, reliable and consistent evidence,the prosecution proved that accused No.2, though knowingfully well that her husband was brutally murdered by accusedNo.1, did not inform anyone nor filed complaint.  The HighCourt held that the trial court was therefore justified inconvicting accused No.2 for commission of offence punishableunder Section 201 I.P.C, but the trial court has imposed lessersentence which is improper, miscarriage of justice and in theresult, enhanced the punishment to seven years.17.At this juncture, I deem it appropriate to extract Section201 of I.P.C for better appreciation. 201. Causing disappearance of evidenceof offence, or giving false information toscreen offender.—Whoever, knowing orhaving reason to believe that an offence hasbeen committed, causes any evidence of thecommission of that offence to disappear,with the intention of screening the offenderfrom legal punishment, or with thatintention gives any information respectingthe offence which he knows or believes to befalse; if a capital offence.—shall, if theoffence which he knows or believes to havebeen committed is punishable with death,be punished with imprisonment of eitherdescription for a term which may extend toseven years, and shall also be liable to fine;if punishable with imprisonment for life.—and if the offence is punishable with141[imprisonment for life], or withimprisonment which may extend to tenyears, shall be punished with imprisonmentof either description for a term which mayextend to three years, and shall also beliable to fine; if punishable with less thanten years’ imprisonment.—and if the offenceis punishable with imprisonment for anyterm not extending to ten years, shall bepunished with imprisonment of thedescription provided for the offence, for aterm which may extend to one-fourth part ofthe longest term of the imprisonment pro-vided for the offence, or with fine, or withboth. Illustration A, knowing that B has murderedZ, assists B to hide the body with theintention of screening B from punishment. Ais liable to imprisonment of eitherdescription for seven years, and also to fine.18.As laid down by this Court in Sou. Vijaya alias Baby Vs.State of Maharashtra, (2003) 8 SCC 296, in order to convicta person under Section 201 of I.P.C, following ingredients arenecessary-a.That an offence has been committed;b.That the accused knew or had reason tobelieve the commission of such offence;c.That with such knowledge or beliefhe/she-1.caused any evidence of the commission ofthat offence to disappear; or2.gave any information respecting thatoffence which he/she knew or believed to15be false;d.That he did so as aforesaid with theintention of screening the offender fromlegal punishment.……..Therefore, to make an accessory expost facto, the first requisite is that theaccused should know about the crimecommitted. In the next place, he mustreceive, relieve, comfort, or assist him andgenerally any assistance whatever given toan offender to hinder his beingapprehended, tried or suffering punishment,makes the assister an accessory.What Section 201 of IPC requires is that theaccused must have had the intention ofscreening the offender. To put it differently,the intention to screen the offender, must bethe primary and sole object of the accused.The fact that the concealment was likely tohave that effect is not sufficient,for Section 201 speaks of intention asdistinct from a mere likelihood.”19.Criminal trial can never be a fanciful flight of imagination.While considering the charge under Section 201 of I.P.C, it ismandatory for the prosecution to prove that the accusedactively participated in the matter of disappearance of evidenceand with an intention to screen the offender.  To convict theaccused for the offence punishable under Section 201 of I.P.C,it is necessary that all the ingredients are satisfied pointingout at the guilt of the accused and a mere suspicion is notsufficient.  Accused can never be convicted on the basis of16probabilities or on assumptions and presumptions.  In thelight of the above, it has to be examined whether the appellanthas committed the offence punishable under Section 201 ofI.P.C.20.The appellant is before this Court questioning the convictionimposed by the trial court which was confirmed by the HighCourt on one hand and on the other hand, she is aggrieved bythe order passed by the High Court in enhancing the sentencefrom 2 years to 7 years.    Having gone through the judgmentpassed by the trial court and specifically the reasoning givenby the Court for convicting the appellant/accused No.2,admittedly, accused No.2/appellant was charged for theoffences punishable under Sections 302, 120(B) and 201 ofI.P.C. read with Section 511 of I.P.C  The trial court hasacquitted accused No.2/appellant on all other charges butconvicted for the offence under Section 201 of I.P.C Here, forbetter appreciation of the issues involved in the case, I wouldlike to extract the relevant portion of the findings of the trialcourt, which read as under: “I am unable to hold accused No.2guilty for the offence of murder for the actdone by accused No.1 of committing themurder of the deceased.  It is true that hersilence may be due to fear and one can17understand that said fear in the mind of thelady who has seen her husband beingattacked with knives as seen in helplesscondition and she had a mind to saveherself and her children from furtherattack…… So, I am aware of the fact thatthis silence on the part of accused No.2 maysuggest that accused No.2 is also one of theconspirators…….……she has declared her desire to have adivorce.  So, she has no mind to murder herhusband at any point of time.  So, these twocircumstances lead me to not to holdaccused No.2 as one of the conspirators ofthe conspiracy to commit the murder of thedeceased.  ….subsequent conduct of accused aresufficient to prove her guilt. Accused No.2can be held for abetting the offence ofdisappearing the evidence of offencecommitted by them.  ….From the above discussed evidence, I amof the view that prosecution has provedbeyond all reasonable doubts that accusedNo.1 had committed the murder of thedeceased by inflicting the multiple injuriesto the deceased with the help of abscondingaccused.   I am of the opinion that accusedNo.2 is not held guilty for the offence ofmurder of the deceased.  Regarding thedisappearance of the evidence of offence,though there is no evidence of theparticipation of accused No.2 indisappearing the said proof of offence ofmurder, but by remaining silence, she hasindirectly abetted the offence ofdisappearance of evidence of murder.  Ireply point is held guilty for the offence ofmurder and accused No.2 is held not guiltyfor the said offence of murder.          I reply18point No.4 that both the accused are heldguilty for the offence of sec. 201 IPC.”21.Looking at the entire findings of the trial court, it is crystalclear that the court has given a clean chit to the appellantsaying that she is in no way involved in commission of thecrime.  At para 73 of the judgment, at one breath a categoricalfinding was given by the trial court that there is no evidence ofparticipation of accused No.2 in disappearing the said proof ofoffence of murder, but by remaining silent, she has indirectlyabetted the offence. At another breath the trial court hasobserved that either out of fear or for the best reason known toher, she remained silent and abetted or aided the offencepunishable under section 201 of IPC. 22.Admittedly, the whole case of the prosecution is based uponcircumstantial evidence except for the evidence of sole eyewitness Ami.  The eye witness, in her statement, has clearlystated that the appellant was crying and she was pleadingaccused No.1 not to kill her husband.  She further stated inthe cross-examination that accused No.1 told hermother/appellant to keep mum and not to make any troubleas accused No1 and the absconding accused will come back.Accused No.2/appellant reiterated the same in her statement19under Section 313 of CrPC.   23.The relevant portion of the evidence of Ami, eye witness, isextracted below:“I jumped from the cot towards my mummy.I went there immediately after getting up.My mummy immediately took me to thedrawing room.  It is not true that my motherwas standing there silently with Pooja, shewas saying “don’t beat…..don’t beat…”“Next day morning, when I got up at 7:30 o’clock morning, Kishorbhai, one more personcame out from the bedroom, and Kishorbhaitried to adore me but I rejected his gesture.At that time, the person with him did nottell anything.  Kishorbhai told my mummyto keep mum and not to make any troubleas they were coming back.”24.The relevant portion of the statement of accusedNo.2/appellant under Section 313 CrPC is as under: “It is true.  While going Kishore hadthreatened me that the corpse is lying inyour house, we are going the entireresponsibility will fall on you, therefore tillthe time we come back till then remainquiet, do not do anything.”25.I am unable to accept the finding of the courts below, thatby remaining silent, accused No.2/appellant has indirectlyabetted the offence of causing disappearance of proof ofmurder.  Remaining silent and absconding with accused No.1and moving from one place to another place will not supply the20evidence or fill the gap which is necessary to prove theingredients under Section 201 of I.P.C.   The trial court, havingspecifically observed that accused No.2 has nothing to do withthe disappearance of evidence and without recording anyfinding with regard to motive, has convicted her under Section201 of I.P.C. In fact the reasoning given by the trial courtmakes it clear that court could not give any reasoning withregard to motive which is the crucial aspect to fasten theliability on the accused. With regard to the factum ofremaining silent the reason is forthcoming from the evidenceof eye witness and the 313 statement of appellant which wasnot taken into consideration. In the present case theprosecution has miserably failed to prove the same.26.The Five Judge Bench of this Court in Raghav PrapannaTripathi v. State of U.P.,  AIR 1963 SC 74, has dealt withSection 201 of I.P.C. and the ingredients to be satisfied forconvicting an accused under Section 201 of I.P.C.  Therelevant portion of the same is as under:“Thus these two appellants have beenrightly convicted and their appeals aredismissed. In regard to the case of RamanujDas and Jai Devi the finding of the HighCourt is that the dead bodies of Kamla andher son Madbusudan were not found in thehouse of Ramanuj Das and they must have21therefore been removed ; that an attemptwas made to wash out the bloodstains frominside the rooms and also outside on theroof ; that the dead bodies could not havebeen removed without the knowledge andactive cooperation of Ramanuj Das and JaiDevi and further that both Ramanuj Dasand Jai Devi absconded. On this basis theconviction of these appellants was held bythe High Court to be justified. It is true thatthe murder was committed in the house ofRamanuj Das and that there is the evidenceto show that the blood inside and outsidethe living rooms was washed and anattempt was made to obliterate any sign of itthough it was unsuccessful. It also may bethat both Ramanuj Das and Jai Devi hadknowledge of the removal of the dead-bodiesbut what s. 201 requires is causing anyevidence of the commission of the offence todisappear or for giving any informationrespecting the offence which a personknows or believes to be false. In this casethere is no evidence of either. It is notshown that these two appellants caused anyevidence to disappear. There may be a verystrong suspicion that if from the house deadbodies are removed or blood was washed,person placed in the position of theappellants must have had a hand in it butstill that remains a suspicion even a strongsuspicion at that. It is true that they wereabsconding but merely absconding will notfill the gap or supply the evidence which isnecessary to prove the ingredients of section201 of the Indian Penal Code. In our opinionthe case against Ramanuj Das and Jai Devihas not been made out. There appeals musttherefore be allowed and they be set atliberty.” 27.In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered22opinion that the trial court went wrong in convicting theappellant without there being any finding with regard to themens rea of the accused as settled by this Court in severalcases.  Particularly, when a specific finding is recorded by thetrial court that there is no evidence for convicting the accusedunder Section 201 of I.P.C., it ought not to have convicted herfor the same more on assumptions and presumptions.  Whenthe appellant and accused no 1 assailed the order of trial courtbefore the High Court, the High Court has issued notice underSection 377 of the Criminal Procedure Code for suo motuenhancement of sentence to the appellant. The High Court hasenhanced the sentence to 7 years by dismissing the appealpreferred by the accused.  The reasoning given by the HighCourt is extracted below: “Evidence shows that accused travelled bypublic transport i.e. AMTC bus.  Therefore,in absence of accused No.1 for nearly 6-7hours in the house, at least she could haveinformed somebody.  Moreover, when shewas moving in various places, she hadample opportunities.  However, she did notutilize any of these opportunities.  All theseclearly involve her actively in the crime inquestion along with accused No.1.”….Thereafter also, she remained silent,went away with the accused No.1, stayed atdifferent public places on fictitious namesas husband and wife and absconded for a23period of one and half months.  From theaforesaid, her active involvement in thecrime in question indicating conspiracy hasbeen established by the prosecution.  Courtbelow dealt with the same howeverdisbelieved the theory of conspiracy.  Eventhough we are not satisfied with the saidreasonings given by the Court below, we arenot dealing with the same as no appeal hasbeen filed in that respect by the State.” ….It may be noted that accused No.2 wasacquitted by the court below for the chargeunder Sec. 302 IPC and conviction onlyunder Sec. 201 IPC.  As stated earlier, sinceState did not prefer any appeal against theacquittal for the charge under Sec. 302 IPC,we are not in a position to deal with the saidaspect.….Though she was knowing fully well thather husband was brutally murdered by theoriginal accused No.1, she did not informanyone nor filed the complaint.  The trialcourt was therefore justified in convictingthe accused No.2 for commission of offencepunishable under Sec. 201 IPC and herconviction is hereby upheld.….It is required to be noted that trial courthas improperly evaluated the evidence onrecord overlooking not only the object ofSec. 201 but also shocking facts of the caseleading to murder of deceased by accusedNo.1 and commission of offence under Sec.201 by accused No.2 and has imposedsentence which is improper and is amiscarriage of justice.  trial court oughthave borne in mind that Sec. 201 is joinedwith Sec. 302 of IPC and should haveawarded sentence accordingly.” 28.There is no dispute with regard to the fact that let24punishment fit the crime is one of the main objects ofsentencing policy.  The sentence should be adequatelyreasonable, proportionate to the nature of culpability is a keyfactor.   Sentencing is a matter of discretion of the trial courtand the appellate Court in the normal circumstances will notinterfere with such discretion.  But will interfere only when itfinds that there is miscarriage of justice, flagrant abuse of lawand where the discretion is not properly exercised by thesentencing Court.  The High Court first and foremost has todeal with the conviction appeal on its own merits and once itcomes to the conclusion that the trial court was right inimposing conviction, then it has to delve into the aspectwhether the punishment was proportionate or not.  From thefinding of the High Court that the appellant is involved activelyin committing the murder and the findings with regard toconspiracy and particularly, in observing that as the State hasnot preferred any appeal against acquittal it is not in aposition to deal with the same, it appears to us that the HighCourt in a prejudiced manner has enhanced the sentence.looking at the entire reasoning of the High Court, I find thatthe findings of the trial court were not disturbed and infactwere upheld by the High Court but it only differed with the25sentencing aspect.   The reasoning given by the appellate courtfor enhancing the sentence and dismissing the appeals can bea valid and correct reasoning for convicting the accused undersection 302 or 120b of I.P.C when the state has preferred anappeal against acquittal. But basing on such reasoning theappellant cannot be convicted under section 201 of I.P.C. Theingredients to attract the offence under section 201 of I.P.C arealtogether different. Her mere silence cannot give rise to apresumption that she has committed the offence.  In theinstant case both the trial court and the appellate Court, failedto appreciate the case in its proper perspective, relied more onassumptions and based on presumptions has convicted theappellant, which is contrary to the settled law.  29.In view of the foregoing discussion, I hold both issues infavor of accused No.2/appellant and against respondent State.30.Generally, in an appeal against conviction, whereconcurrent findings were recorded by both the Courts below,this Court will not interfere.  But, this is a case where both theCourts below, without satisfying the ingredients of Section 201of I.P.C., have convicted accused No.2/appellant more onsurmises and conjectures, which invited interference of thiscourt.2631.Pondering over the ongoing discussion, I hold thatprosecution has not been able to prove the guilt of theappellant/accused No.2 for the offence punishable underSection 201 of I.P.C beyond reasonable doubt.   It is broughtto the notice of this Court that the appellant/accused No.2 hasalready undergone the sentence imposed by the trial court.  Iset aside the order passed by the High Court in CriminalAppeal No. 833 of 1997 and Crl.M.A. No. 1121 of 1998 inCrl.A. No. 833 of 1997 and accordingly the appeal standsallowed.   .................................J(N. V. RAMANA)NEW DELHIDATED:  July 17, 201727                                                                  REPORTABLEIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIACRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTIONCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 40 OF 2007Padmini Mahendrabhai Gadda                    Appellant                         VersusState of Gujarat                               RespondentJ U D G M E N TPrafulla C. Pant, J.I have benefit of reading draft judgment dictated by My LordHon’ble Mr. Justice N.V. Ramana whereby His Lordship has heldthat the charge of offence punishable under Section 201 ofIndian Penal Code (IPC) against the appellant stood notproved, and conviction recorded against her is liable to beset aside.  With great respect, I humbly differ with the saidview for the reasons recorded hereunder: -2. Briefly stated the prosecution story is that the appellantgot married to Mahendrabhai (deceased) in the year 1981 andtwo daughters born from the wedlock.  The family used to livein Shakuntal Apartments, Ahmedabad.  The deceased was running28a Health Club one in Chitranjan Society, Naranpura andanother in Shakuntal Apartments.  PW-3 Pradip Kamdar(complainant) is the brother of the appellant.  Earlier theappellant along with her family used to live with thecomplainant, before they shifted to Shakuntal Apartments.Kishore Thakker (A-1) was employee in the Health Club run bythe deceased.  He developed illicit relationship with theappellant.  When appellant told the complainant that shewanted to sever her relations with the deceased, thecomplainant and his wife advised her not to take such step asshe had two children from the wedlock.  On this she respondedby saying that Kishorebhai (A-1) also looks after them well.Thereafter, when Mahendrabhai was advised by the complainantnot to allow A-1 in his house, he removed A-1 from service.On 11.12.1994, the appellant along with her husband(deceased) and children came to the house of the complainantfor lunch and returned at about 2.30 p.m. The daughters wereaged eight years and four years. The two families used tokeep in touch regularly on phone.  In the morning of12.12.1994, wife of the complainant tried to enquire aboutthe health of younger daughter of the appellant.  But thephone was continuously engaged.  At about 11.30 a.m. when sherang the appellant and enquired about her husband (deceased),she (appellant) told her that he had gone to Naranpura HealthClub.  Thereafter, the complainant (PW-3) gave a ring at 3.00p.m.  The appellant informed that Mahendrabhai (deceased) hadgone to Bombay.  This made the complainant suspicious as29Mahendrabhai, whenever went out from Ahmedabad, used toinform him.  At about 4.00 p.m., the complainant along withhis wife came to the house of his sister (appellant) and rangthe door bell.  When they entered in the house, they saw thatyounger daughter Pooja was lying near the dining table infever.  When the complainant asked the appellant as to thereason for Mahendrabhai to go to Bombay, the appellant gaveexplanation that Mahendrabhai had asked her not to disclosehis visit to Bombay.  Since it was 4.00 p.m. and Ami (PW-34),elder daughter of the appellant was to be brought back fromthe school, PW-3 asked the appellant to go and bring thechild.  Meanwhile, PW-3 found that bath room of the appellantwas locked from inside.  Suddenly the door of the bath roomwas opened from inside and Kishore (A-1), who had illicitrelations with the appellant, came out, and tried to runaway.  His shirt was not buttoned. When he was attempted tobe stopped, his shirt dropped and he ran away with pantsonly.  Thereafter, the complainant entered inside thebathroom and saw the dead body of Mahendrabhai was in thepool of blood.  The appellant, who was sent to bring Ami(PW-34) did not return.  As such, the complainant leaving hiswife in the house of the appellant, went to the school andbrought Ami.  3. Thereafter, the complainant went to Ellisbridge PoliceStation, then to Navrangpura Police Station, and gave theFirst Information Report (Exh. 22), which was registered asICR No. 759 of 1994.  The police came to the house of the30appellant, took the dead body into their possession, preparedthe inquest report and the dead body was sent for post mortemexamination.   PW-1 Dr. Dilip Manubhai Desai conducted postmortem examination and prepared the autopsy report(Exh.-17/18).  On completion of investigation, charge sheetwas filed against Kishorebhai (A-1) and the appellant (A-2)for their trial in respect of offences punishable underSections 302, 120B and 201 IPC.  The trial court, onconclusion of trial, convicted A-1 under Sections 302 and 201IPC. However, the appellant (A-2) was acquitted of the chargeunder Section 302 IPC, but convicted under Section 201 IPC.A-1 was awarded imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.5000/-under Section 302 IPC, and each one of A-1 and A-2 wassentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years and to payfine of Rs.5000/-, in default of which to undergo furtherthree months rigorous imprisonment under Section 201 IPC.4. The two convicts filed separate appeals (Criminal AppealNo. 831 of 1997 by A-1 and Criminal Appeal No. 833 of 1997 byA-2) before the High Court.  The High Court issued notice forenhancement of sentence as against A-2 only in respect ofoffence punishable under Section 201 IPC.  It is relevant tomention here that the State did not file any appeal againstacquittal of A-2 in respect of offence punishable underSection 302 IPC.  After hearing the parties, the appeals ofA-1 as well as of A-2 were dismissed by the High Court, andthe sentence of A-2 was enhanced to rigorous imprisonment forseven years and to pay fine of Rs.7,000/-, in default she was31directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years.Aggrieved by said order dated 04.10.2006 passed by the HighCourt, A-2 is before us in this appeal.5. Contentions of learned counsel for the parties are alreadymentioned in the judgment by my Lord Hon’ble Mr. Justice N.V.Ramana and need not be repeated.6. Perusal of the record shows that in all 48 witnesses wereexamined by the prosecution.  7. PW-1 Dr. Dilip Manubhai Desai, who conducted post mortemexamination on the dead body of the deceased on 13.12.1994,has proved homicidal death of the deceased (Mahendrabhai).He has deposed that there were fifty ante mortem externalinjuries on the dead body out of which external injury Nos.13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 28 and 30 were sufficient to causedeath in the ordinary course of nature.  He further told thatthe injuries were possibly caused by knife.  The cause ofdeath reported by him was shock and hemorrhage as a result ofstab injuries sustained by the deceased.  He has proved hisreports Exh. 17/18.8. PW-3 Pradip Kamdar (complainant), who is brother of theappellant, has narrated the entire prosecution story, asmentioned above.  For brevity, the same is not beingrepeated.9. PW-34 Ami is the elder (minor) daughter of the appellant.She has stated that her father used to run Health Clubs inNaranpura and Shakuntal Apartments.  Kishore (A-1) used towork in the Health Club, who was removed from service before32Diwali.  She further told that in the fateful night (11th and12th December, 1994) she woke up when the bed was pushed.She saw two persons – Kishore and one lean person beating herfather.  (The said lean person is still reported to beabsconding) She further told that her mother was standingnear the door with Pooja (younger daughter of the appellant).She further stated that when she started crying, she wastaken by her mother to drawing room.  She further told thatthereafter she did not know as to what had happened, and whenin the morning she got up, she saw Kishore (A-1) and hisassociate leaving the room.  She further stated that nextmorning her mother told her to take bath in the bathroomattached to another room.  She stated that she was studyingin Vandana School.  She has also corroborated the fact in thecross-examination that her maternal uncle (complainant) cameto receive her in the school.  10. The statement of PW-3 Pradip Kamdar gets corroborated notonly from the statement of PW-34 Ami, but also from thestatement of PW-23 Minaben Deepakbhai Desai.  This witnesshas stated that on 12.12.1994 when she was bringing her sonfrom Vandana School to her home, she met the appellant nearVandana School.  She also saw that Kishore (A-1) came in anautorikshaw.  There was no clothe on his upper part of thebody and he was only in pants.  He asked her (PW-23) to callPadmini (appellant).  She called her and Padmini went inautorikshaw with Kishore (A-1).3311. PW-7 Yogesh Pannalal has deposed that on 12.12.1994between 4.00 and 5.00 p.m. a man barefooted and without anyclothe on the upper part of the body came in his shop with alady.  They asked for a T-shirt and purchased a jersey.  Thelady paid for it.  This witness has identified A-1 as the manwho came barefoot and without clothe on the upper part of thebody and A-2 as the lady who paid the money.  12. PW-6 Navabahamad Rafiyuddin Shaikh further corroboratesthe story by deposing that he was running a shoe shop and on12.12.1994 at about 6.00 p.m. a person barefoot came to hisshop along with a lady and purchased chappal for Rs.45/- andthe lady paid the money.13. Subsequent to the incident as to how A-1 and A-2absconded and lived together that too has come on record inthe testimony of PW-19, PW-28, PW-32, PW-39 and PW-40.  PW-19Kanubhai Somabhai Valand has stated that he is Manager ofNayisamaj Dharamshala and he told that A-1 and A-2 lived inthe Dharamshala (with fictitious names).  PW-28 IbrahimbhaiNasirbhai who is owner of Dreamland Hotel, PW-32 SuryakantChamanlal, PW-39 Ramaji Rupsing, Manager of DadavadiGurumandir Dharamshala, PW-40 Jagdishkumar Amrutlal Soni,Manager of Shree Parshwanath Bhaktivihar Jain TrustDharamshala, have also given the similar statements regardingabove fact for different dates as to how A-1 and A-2 lived inDharamshalas and Hotel with fictitious names.  Theyidentified both the accused in the court.  The two accused34lived together in the above manner from 12.12.1994 till23.01.1995, before they were arrested.14. It has also come on record in the evidence of policewitnesses that after commission of murder the bed room wasfound cleaned and body of the deceased was found concealed inthe bathroom in an attempt to cut and dispose of the same inpieces for which needle, jute thread, plastic bags, ironblade, etc. were collected from the house.  It has also comeon record that around noon A-1 was allowed by A-2 to go outto get his hand bandaged.  In this connection PW-4 Dr.Rajendra Hiralal Shah has adduced the evidence relating tobandaging and proved the relevant entries.  15. In the light of the circumstances, from the evidence onrecord, in my opinion it is clearly established that bymaking false statement by appellant to her own brother PW-3(complainant) as to whereabouts of the deceased, and notallowing PW-34 Ami to use the bathroom attached to thebedroom (where dead body was concealed), the appellant hasgiven false information to screen offender (A-1).  As such,she was rightly held guilty by the courts below in respect ofcharge of offence punishable under Section 201 IPC.  Someobservations of the trial court against its own finding as toguilt of A-2 are not relevant for the decision of this court,particularly when judgment of the trial court stands mergedin the judgment of the High Court which is impugned before usand, as such, the appellant cannot be acquitted from thecharge of offence punishable under Section 201 IPC.  I agree35with the principle of law laid down by this Court, asreferred to by my Lord Hon’ble Mr. Justice N.V. Ramana, butfinally in each case the facts and evidence of thatparticular case are to be seen to come to the conclusion asto whether the ingredients of a particular offence have beenmade out or not.16. For the reasons, as discussed above, I find no error oflaw in the orders passed by the courts below in concludingthat the appellant Padmini is guilty of the charge of offencepunishable under Section 201 IPC.  However, as to thesentence, the High Court has awarded the maximum sentence toA-2 (appellant).  Learned counsel for the appellant pointedout from the record that the appellant has already servedmore than two years’ imprisonment during the period oftrial/appeal.  She is sixty years old, and twenty three yearshave passed from the date of incident.  In thesecircumstances, I am of the view that since the sentence underSection 201 IPC awarded to A-1 has attained the finality inrespect of the same charge, as such, it would not bejustified to award A-2 the enhanced sentence as directed bythe High Court, particularly considering her role in respectof said charge, compared to that of A-1.17. Therefore, the appeal is partly allowed.  The convictionrecorded by the courts below against the appellant in respectof offence punishable under Section 201 IPC is upheld but thesentence awarded by the High Court is reduced to two years']\""

the spot when the police had startedinvestigation . xxmaj furthermore , the investigating officer also testifiedthat immediately after reaching the village xxmaj semaria , where theincident took place , he had called the xxmaj patel ( xxup pw \\ xad9 ) . xxmaj xxunk admitted that he called xxup pw \\ xad9 to the place of theoccurrence and that he ( xxup pw \\ xad9 ) was present during the course ofthe investigation . xxup pw \\ xad9 , being the xxmaj patel of the village , could nothave kept the fact about the incident or about the complicity ofthe accused from the investigating officer at the first instance , had he really been an eye witness to the incident . xxmaj theinvestigating officer had proceeded to depose that , on his own , hehad recorded the statement of xxup pw \\ xad9 on xxunk , which meansthat xxup pw \\ xad9 had not informed the investigating officer that he wasan eye witness to the incident . xxmaj the investigating officer , on xxunk accord , had recorded the statement of xxup pw \\ xad9 . xxmaj it is thus clearthat the investigating officer knew very well , on the first day itself , that xxup pw \\ xad9 was an eye witness . xxmaj there was no reason as to why theinvestigating officer did not record the statement of the so \\ xxunk witness at the earliest point of time , more particularly when , at that point in time , the investigating officer did not have xxunk about the murderers . xxup pw \\ xad9 and xxup pw \\ xad16 are close friends , and on the date of theincident , had gone together to see xxmaj xxunk dance in the xxunk night , and at that point in time , both of them heard xxunk of the deceased and rushed to the spot and saw the xxunk the murder of the deceased . xxmaj it is also the evidence ofpw \\ xad9 and xxup pw \\ xad16 that the accused saw these witnesses at thetime of the occurrence of the murder inasmuch as thesewitnesses told all the accused not to beat / assault the deceased . xxmaj on hearing such utterance of these witnesses , the xxunk tried to chase them , but they fled away from the scene . xxmaj if this were true , then xxup pw \\ xad9 , who was present at the spot duringthe course of the investigation on the first day itself , would nothave left the police uninformed about the presence of xxup pw \\ xad16 xxunk is also relevant to note that xxup pw \\ xad16 is from a different village , namely , xxmaj xxunk , which is stated to be 75 xxup k.m. away fromthe place of incident , and on the date of the incident he had cometo the village xxmaj semaria where the incident had taken place . xxmaj theplace of work of xxup pw \\ xad16 is xxmaj xxunk , which is stated to be 70 xxunk from xxmaj semaria village . xxmaj it is curious to note that xxup pw \\ xad9 andpw \\ xad16 met on the date of incident after a gap of about 15 years , and thereafter went to watch the dance performance . xxmaj in ourconsidered opinion , the story , as put forth by the prosecution , that xxup pw \\ xad9 did not tell the investigating officer about the presenceof xxup pw \\ xad16 , is not believable . xxmaj according to xxup pw \\ xad16 , he came to thevillage xxmaj semaria after eight days , i.e. after the arrest of a xxunk , and gave the statement to the xxunk per the case of the prosecution , xxmaj balwan xxmaj singh is xxunk and influential person and the eye witnesses xxunk of him . xxmaj it is relevant to note that even at the time of therecording of the statements of xxup pw \\ xad9 and xxup pw \\ xad16 after eight daysof the incident , xxmaj balwan xxmaj singh was not arrested . xxmaj he was xxunk about two months from the recording of the statements ofthese witnesses . xxmaj it is relevant to note that these witnesses xxunk scared of other accused who were arrested . xxmaj be that as it may , we find that the whole story of the prosecution about thepresence of xxup pw \\ xad9 and xxup pw \\ xad16 on the spot at the time of xxunk to be artificial and xxunk prosecution also relies upon the evidence relating torecovery of sticks and tabbal which were bloodstained . xxmaj suchevidence may not be helpful to the prosecution in this caseinasmuch as there is no evidence to show that these articles xxunk with human blood , and more particularly with blood ofthe same blood group as that of the deceased . xxmaj as per theforensic xxmaj science xxmaj laboratory xxmaj report , the blood stains xxunk , and their origin could not be determined . xxmaj in xxmaj sattatiya v. xxmaj state of xxmaj maharashtra , ( 2008 ) 3 xxup scc xxunk of the crucial factors that had led this xxmaj court to reverse theconviction was that the bloodstains on the items seized in therecovery could not be linked with the blood of the deceased . xxmaj thisfactor was treated as a serious lacuna in the case of theprosecution . xxmaj similarly , in xxmaj shantabai and xxmaj ors . v. xxmaj state ofmaharashtra , ( 2008 ) 16 xxup scc 354 , the bloodstains on some of9the clothes seized from the accused in recovery belonged to adifferent blood group from that of the blood group of xxunk on the clothes of the deceased and on the sample of soil , axe , stones etc . which were taken from the spot by theinvestigating officer . xxmaj as a result of this mismatch , it was held thatthis circumstance was not proved against the accused . xxmaj it is also important to note the following observations madeby a xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench of this xxmaj court in xxmaj raghav xxunk & xxmaj ors . v. xxmaj state of xxup u.p. , xxup air ( 1963 ) xxup sc xxunk . xxmaj in this connection , reference may also bemade to circumstances 9 and 10 , relating to therecovery of the bloodstained earth from the house . xxmaj the bloodstained earth has not been proved to xxunk with human blood . xxmaj again , we are of opinionthat it would be far \\ xxunk to conclude from themere presence of bloodstained earth that earth xxunk with human blood and that the human xxunk of xxmaj kamla and xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj thesecircumstances have , therefore , no evidentiary value . ” ( xxmaj emphasis supplied)therefore , the five \\ xadjudge bench had ruled that in that casethe prosecution needed to prove that the bloodstains found onthe earth or the weapons were of a human origin and were of thesame blood group as that of the xxunk are also conscious of the fact that , at times , it may bevery difficult for the serologist to detect the origin of the xxunk to the disintegration of the serum , or insufficiency of blood \\ xadstains , or xxunk changes etc . xxmaj in such situations , thecourt , using its judicious mind , may deny the benefit of doubt tothe accused , depending on the facts and circumstances of eachcase , if other evidence of the prosecution is credible and xxunk doubt does not arise in the mind of the xxmaj court aboutthe investigation . xxmaj thus , in the case of xxup r. xxmaj shaji v. xxmaj state of xxmaj kerala , ( 2013 ) xxup 14scc 266 , this xxmaj court had xxunk . a failure by the serologist to detect theorigin of the blood due to disintegration of xxunk does not mean that the blood stuck on theaxe could not have been human blood at all . xxmaj sometimes it is possible , either because the stain isinsufficient in itself , or due to xxunk and xxunk xxunk , that xxunk may fail to detect the origin of the xxunk question . xxmaj however , in such a case , unless xxunk is of a reasonable dimension which xxunk conscientious mind may entertain withsome objectivity , no benefit can be claimed by theaccused in this regard . xxmaj once the recovery is madein pursuance of a disclosure statement made xxunk accused , the matching or non \\ xxunk ofblood xxunk ) loses xxunk observations were made by this xxmaj court in the case xxunk xxmaj singh v. xxmaj state of xxmaj rajasthan , ( 2001 ) 2 xxup scc 205 , whereinit was observed that it was not possible to accept the submissionmade on behalf of the accused that in the absence of the xxunk the origin of the blood , the accused could not havebeen convicted , inasmuch as it was only because of the lapse oftime that blood could not be classified successfully . xxmaj in the case of xxmaj jagroop xxmaj singh v. xxmaj state of xxmaj punjab , ( xxunk xxup scc 768 , this xxmaj court had ruled that as the recovery was madepursuant to a disclosure statement made by the accused , and xxunk report had found that the blood was of human origin , the non \\ xaddetermination of the blood group had lost itssignificance . xxmaj in the case of xxmaj state of xxmaj rajasthan v. xxmaj teja xxmaj ram andothers , ( 1999 ) 3 xxup scc 507 , the xxmaj court had observed that thefailure of the serologist to detect the origin of the blood , due xxunk of the serum , did not mean that the blood stuck onthe weapon could not have been human blood at all . xxmaj in xxunk , it was noted that it could not be said that in all caseswhere there was a failure in detecting the origin of blood , thecircumstance arising from recovery of the weapon would xxunk to xxunk . xxmaj it was thus observed that unless the xxunk of a reasonable dimension which a judicially xxunk entertained with some objectivity , no benefit could beclaimed by the xxunk , we can not lose sight of the fact that the accusedwould be in a disadvantageous position in case if theaforementioned dictum laid down by this xxmaj court in the cases xxunk xxmaj shaji ( supra ) , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj singh ( supra ) , xxmaj jagroop xxmaj singh ( supra)and xxmaj teja xxmaj ram ( supra ) relating to the blood \\ xadstains is applied ineach and every case . xxmaj non \\ xxunk of blood \\ xxunk or origin ofthe blood may assume importance in cases where the xxunk a defence or alleges mala fides on the part of theprosecution , or xxunk the prosecution of fabricating

xxup scc 129 , thiscourt , on facts , observed that the evidence of recovery ofweapons was credible . xxmaj the xxmaj forensic xxmaj science xxmaj report ( xxup fsl ) xxunk disclosed that the blood was of human origin . xxmaj the xxmaj courtproceeded to conclude that since the evidence of recovery xxunk was proved to the satisfaction of the xxmaj court , it wassufficient that the prosecution had proved that the xxunk of human origin , even though the blood group could not xxunk cases discussed above highlight the burden that theprosecution would ordinarily have to discharge , depending on theother facts and circumstances of the case , for the xxunk to recovery to be considered against the accused . xxmaj at thesame time , as mentioned above , we are conscious of the fact thatit may not always be possible to inextricably link the xxunk the items seized in recovery to the blood of the deceased , dueto the possibility of disintegration of bloodstains on account ofthe time \\ xxunk in carrying out the recovery . xxmaj for this reason , xxunk xxmaj dayal v. xxmaj state of xxmaj rajasthan , ( 2018 ) 8 xxup scc 127 , xxunk of us ( xxmaj mohan xxup m. xxmaj shantanagoudar xxup j. ) had

ballistic xxmaj expert and the xxmaj forensic sciencelaboratory regarding the weapon used to commit xxunk the aforementioned discussion , we can xxunk if the recovery of bloodstained articles is proved beyondreasonable doubt by the prosecution , and if the investigation wasnot found to be tainted , then it may be sufficient if theprosecution shows that the blood found on the articles is ofhuman origin though , even though the blood group is not xxunk of disintegration of blood . xxmaj the xxmaj court will have to come tothe conclusion based on the facts and circumstances of xxunk ,

xxmaj high xxmaj court and the appeal was decided on merits but without examining as to whether the leave to file an appeal by the appellant is required to be granted or not under the above provisions of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. 6.the learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of this xxmaj court towards the decision rendered by xxmaj delhi xxmaj high xxmaj court in the case referred to supra

in partners , etc . of the victim , who are in a position to do so in his / her behalf . xxmaj he urged that in the instant case , there is no need for the appellant , being the father of the deceased

decision of xxmaj delhi xxmaj high xxmaj court referred to supra upon which strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the appellant . xxmaj there is no doubt that the appellant , being the father of the deceased , has locus standi to prefer an appeal before the xxmaj high xxmaj court under proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. as he falls within the definition of victim as defined under xxmaj section 2(wa ) of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. to question the correctness of the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the trial court in favour of respondent nos . 2 to 6 in xxmaj sessions xxmaj case xxmaj no . 293 / 2010 . 10.the proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. was amended by xxmaj act xxmaj no.5 of 2009 . xxmaj the said proviso confers a xxmaj page xxunk right upon the victim , as defined under xxmaj section 2(wa ) of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. to prefer an appeal against an order passed by the trial court either acquitting the accused or convicting him / her for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation . xxmaj in this regard , the xxmaj full xxmaj bench of xxmaj delhi xxmaj high xxmaj court in the case referred to supra has elaborately dealt with the legislative history of insertion of the proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. by xxmaj act xxmaj no . 5 of 2009 with effect from 31.12.2009 . xxmaj the relevant provision of xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. reads xxunk . xxmaj no appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a xxmaj criminal xxmaj court except as provided for by this xxmaj code or by any other law for the time being in force : xxmaj provided that the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the xxmaj court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation , and such appeal shall lie to the xxmaj court to which an appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction of such xxunk said amendment to the provision of xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. was prompted by 154th xxmaj law xxmaj commission xxmaj report . xxmaj the said xxmaj law xxmaj commission xxmaj report has undertaken a comprehensive review of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. and its xxmaj page xxunk were found to be very appropriate in amending the xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. particularly in relation to provisions concerning arrest , custody and remand , procedure to be followed in summons and warrant - cases , compounding of offences and special protection in respect of women and inquiry and trial of persons of unsound mind . xxmaj further , the xxmaj law xxmaj commission in its report has noted the relevant aspect of the matter namely that the victims are the worst sufferers in a crime and they do not have much role in the xxmaj court proceedings . xxmaj they need to be given certain rights and compensation so that there is no distortion of the criminal justice system . xxmaj the said report of the xxmaj law xxmaj commission has also taken note of the views of the xxunk , xxunk and reformers of criminal justice system at length and has focused on xxunk , control of victimization and protection of the victims of crimes and the issues of compensation to be awarded in favour of them . xxmaj therefore , the xxmaj parliament on the basis of the aforesaid xxmaj report of the xxmaj law xxmaj commission , which is victim oriented in approach , has amended certain provisions of the xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. and in that amendment the xxmaj page xxunk to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. was added to confer the statutory right upon the victim to prefer an appeal before the xxmaj high xxmaj court against acquittal order , or an order convicting the accused for the lesser offence or against the order imposing inadequate compensation . 11.the xxmaj full xxmaj bench of the xxmaj high xxmaj court of xxmaj delhi after examining the relevant provisions under xxmaj section 2(wa ) and proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. , in the light of their legislative history has held that the right to prefer an appeal conferred upon the victim or relatives of the victim by virtue of proviso to xxmaj section 372 is an independent statutory right . xxmaj therefore , it has held that there is no need for the victim in terms of definition under xxmaj section 2(wa ) of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. to seek the leave of the xxmaj high xxmaj court as required under sub - xxmaj section ( 3 ) of xxmaj section 378 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. to prefer an appeal under proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. xxmaj the said view of the xxmaj high xxmaj court is not legally correct for the reason that the substantive provision of xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. clearly provides that no appeal shall lie from any judgment and order xxmaj page xxrep 4 1 of a xxmaj criminal xxmaj court except as provided for by xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. xxmaj further , sub - xxmaj section ( 3 ) to xxmaj section 378 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. provides that for preferring an appeal to the xxmaj high xxmaj court against an order of acquittal it is necessary to obtain its leave . xxmaj we have to refer to the rules of interpretation of statutes to find out what is the effect of the proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. , it is well established that the proviso of a statute must be given an interpretation limited to the subject - matter of the enacting provision . xxmaj reliance is placed on the decision of this xxmaj court rendered by four xxmaj judge xxmaj bench in xxmaj dwarka xxmaj prasad v. xxmaj dwarka xxmaj das xxmaj xxunk , the relevant para 18 of which reads thus:“18 . … a proviso must be limited to the subject - matter of the enacting clause . xxmaj it is a settled rule of construction that a proviso must prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a proviso . xxmaj it is not a separate or independent enactment . “ xxmaj words are dependent on the principal enacting words to which they are xxunk as a proviso . xxmaj they can not be read as divorced from their context ” ( xxmaj xxunk v. xxmaj xxunk , 1912 xxup ac 533 ) . xxmaj if the rule of construction is that prima facie a proviso should be limited in its operation to the subject - matter of the enacting clause , the stand we have taken is sound . xxmaj to expand the enacting clause , inflated by the proviso , sins against the fundamental rule of construction 2 ( 1976 ) 1 xxup scc xxunk xxunk a proviso must be considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso . a proviso ordinarily is but a proviso , although the golden rule is to read the whole section , inclusive of the proviso , in such manner that they mutually throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction . ” ( emphasis laid by this xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj further , a three xxmaj judge xxmaj bench of this xxmaj court by majority of 2:1 in the case of xxup s. xxmaj sundaram xxmaj pillai v. xxup v.r. xxmaj xxunk has elaborately examined the scope of proviso to the substantive provision of the xxmaj section and rules of its interpretation . xxmaj the relevant paras are reproduced xxunk . xxmaj xxunk in xxmaj interpretation of xxmaj statutes at pages 294 - 295 has collected the following principles in regard to a xxunk one finds a proviso to a section the natural presumption is that , but for the proviso , the enacting part of the section would have included the subject - matter of the xxunk proviso must be construed with reference to the preceding parts of the clause to which it is xxunk the proviso is directly repugnant to a section , the proviso shall stand and be held a repeal of the section as the proviso speaks the latter intention of the xxunk the section is doubtful , a proviso may be used as a guide to its 3 ( 1985 ) 1 xxup scc xxunk xxunk : but when it is clear , a proviso can not imply the existence of words of which there is no trace in the xxunk proviso is subordinate to the main xxunk proviso does not enlarge an enactment except for compelling xxunk an unnecessary proviso is inserted by way of abundant xxunk construction placed upon a proviso which brings it into general harmony with the terms of section should xxunk a proviso is repugnant to the enacting part , the proviso will not prevail over the absolute terms of a later xxmaj act directed to be read as supplemental to the earlier xxunk proviso may sometimes contain a substantive provision . xxup xxx xxup xxx xxup xxx 32 . xxmaj in xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk v. xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk it was held that the main object of a proviso is merely to qualify the main enactment . xxmaj in xxmaj madras and xxmaj southern xxmaj xxunk xxmaj railway xxmaj co. xxmaj ltd. v. xxmaj xxunk xxmaj municipality xxmaj lord xxmaj xxunk observed thus:“the proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment , and its effect is xxmaj page xxunk to that xxunk . xxmaj the above case was approved by this xxmaj court in xxup cit v. xxmaj indo xxmaj mercantile xxmaj bank xxmaj ltd. where xxmaj kapur , xxup j. held that the proper function of a proviso was merely to qualify the generality of the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out , as it were , from the main enactment a portion which , but for the proviso , would fall within the main enactment . xxmaj in xxmaj shah xxmaj bhojraj xxmaj xxunk xxmaj oil xxmaj mills and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj factory v. xxmaj xxunk xxmaj chandra xxmaj yograj xxmaj sinha xxmaj hidayatullah , xxup j. , as he then was , very aptly and succinctly indicated the parameters of a proviso xxunk a general rule , a proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment , and ordinarily , a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule . ” xxup xxx xxup xxx xxup xxunk . xxmaj while interpreting a proviso care must be taken that it is used to remove special cases from the general enactment and provide for them xxunk . xxmaj in short , generally speaking , a proviso is intended to limit the enacted provision so as to except something which would have otherwise been within it or in some measure to modify the enacting clause . xxmaj sometimes a proviso may be embedded in the main provision and becomes an integral part of it so as to amount to a substantive provision itself . ” ( emphasis xxunk , from a reading of the abovesaid legal position laid down by this xxmaj court in the cases referred to xxmaj page xxunk , it is abundantly clear that the proviso to xxmaj section 372 of xxmaj cr . xxup p.c. must be read along with its main enactment i.e. ,

xxup 13(3)(iii ) of the xxmaj rules , as the discharge of theappellant was only on the ground of his medical unfitness forfurther service , therefore , he could not be invalidated out ofservice

category 13(3)(iii)(iii ) ashe has been found medically unfit for further service . xxmaj clause ( v ) ofrule xxup 13(3)(iii ) would be applicable in respect of all other classes ofdischarge which do not find mention in xxmaj rule xxup 13(3)(iii ) . xxmaj thecommunication of discharge from the service is on the ground thathe has been placed in the xxmaj low xxmaj medical xxmaj category . xxmaj once he hasbeen put in xxmaj low xxmaj medical xxmaj category , clause ( iii ) of xxmaj rule 13(3)(iii)would be applicable as such clause alone deals with discharge xxunk personnel is found medically unfit for further service . xxmaj there isno reference to sub - clause ( v ) of xxmaj army xxmaj rule xxup 13(3)(iii ) in the order ofdischarge . xxmaj still further , it is not the recital of a provision which isrelevant to determine as to whether the personnel is dischargedunder clause ( v ) or clause ( iii ) of xxmaj rule xxup 13(3)(iii ) of the xxmaj rules . xxmaj it isthe object , language and the purport of the discharge which will berelevant to determine whether an army personnel had beendischarged under clause ( iii ) or clause ( v ) . xxmaj clause ( v ) is theresidual clause when other clauses are not applicable to suchpersonnel . xxmaj since the discharge of the appellant is covered byclause ( iii ) of xxmaj rule xxup 13(3)(iii ) of the xxmaj rules , as the discharge of theappellant was only on the ground of his medical unfitness forfurther service , therefore , he could not be invalidated out ofservice without the recommendation of the xxmaj invalidating xxmaj board . xxunk xxmaj court in xxmaj smt . xxmaj sulekha xxmaj rani v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india and xxmaj xxunk that when the discharge was on the ground of medicalunfitness , the

22 . xxmaj after considering the submissions made by both theparties , i find that xxup pw7 xxmaj sohan xxmaj lal eye \\ xadwitness to theoccurrence has specifically stated in his affidavit xxmaj ex .

23 . xxmaj the statement of this witness clearlyestablishes that this was the sole negligence on thepart of the driver of the gas tanker especially whenthe accident was caused on 15.12.2011 that too atabout 10.30 p.m. which is generally time of xxunk . xxmaj in this way , the driver of the car cannotbe held in any way negligent in this accident . xxmaj moreover , as per xxmaj rules 15 of the

road that too xxunk time when there is neither any indicator xxunk lights nor xxunk lights nor any xxunk given on the back of the xxunk , therefore , the driver of the car can not beheld to be in any

xxup xxunk ( xxmaj allahabad ) . xxmaj it is not the case of the respondentthat the parking lights of the standing truck wereon or there were any other indication n the backside of the vehicle

driver could have avoided theaccident , so the driver of the car was xxunk in causing the accident can not beaccepted when it has already been held that xxunk has been caused due to sole negligence ofthe driver of the offending stationed truck in xxunk road . xxmaj the proposition of law laid down in xxmaj smt . xxmaj harbans xxmaj kaur & others ’s case ( 2010 4 xxup plr 422 ( xxunk xxup t.m. xxmaj xxunk & another ’s case ( 2005 xxup iv xxup acc xxup xxunk ) is not disputed at all but these authorities are nothelpful to the respondents being not applicable on thefacts and circumstances of

xxmaj high xxmaj court reported xxunk xxmaj devi vs. xxmaj krishan xxmaj kumar xxmaj xxunk andothers , 1986 xxup acj 331 . xxmaj moreover , the respondentno.1 has also not filed any complaint to xxunk about his false implication in xxunk case so it can not be accepted that therespondent no.1 has been falsely implicated in thiscase . 27 . xxmaj in view of above discussion , it is held that

of factrecorded by the xxmaj tribunal in relation to issue xxmaj no.1 and opinedthat it was a case of contributory negligence of the driver ofthe xxmaj maruti xxmaj car which met with the accident . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj xxunk the said issue in its judgment as can be xxunk paragraphs 14 & 15 , which read thus : “ 14 . xxmaj so far as the issue of contributory negligence isconcerned , it has come in the testimony of xxmaj sohan xxmaj lal , xxup pw \\ xad7 , that the tanker / offending vehicle was xxunk indicator but the same was visible from adistance of 70 ft . xxmaj moreover , a perusal of site plan xxmaj ex . p xxunk that the offending vehicle was not parked in themiddle of the road . 15 . xxmaj in view of the statement of xxup pw \\ xad7 and site plan xxmaj ex . p \\ xad45 , it is proved that the tanker / offending vehicle xxunk from a distance of 70 ft . and not parked in themiddle of the road . xxmaj therefore , in the concerned opinion ofthis xxmaj court , it is a case of contributory negligence . ” 7.in the present appeals , the moot question is whether thehigh xxmaj court committed manifest error in reversing the xxunk decision of the xxmaj tribunal on issue xxmaj no.1 answeredagainst the respondents , instead concluding that it was a caseof 50 % contributory negligence on the part of the xxunk of the xxmaj maruti xxmaj car . 8.after having perused the evidence of xxup pw \\ xad7 , xxmaj site xxmaj map ( xxmaj ext . p \\ xad45 ) and the detailed analysis undertaken by the xxmaj tribunal , we have no hesitation in taking the view that the approach ofthe xxmaj high xxmaj court in reversing the conclusion arrived at by thetribunal on issue xxmaj no.1 has been very casual , if not cryptic xxunk . xxmaj indeed , the appeal before the xxmaj high xxmaj court is requiredto be decided on fact and law . xxmaj that , however , would not xxunk xxmaj high xxmaj court to casually overturn the finding of factrecorded by the xxmaj tribunal . xxmaj as is evident from the analysis doneby the xxmaj tribunal , it is a well considered opinion and a xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court has not adverted to any specific reasonas to why the view taken by the xxmaj tribunal was incorrect or notsupported by the evidence on record . xxmaj it is well settled that thenature of proof required in cases concerning accident claims xxunk different from the one in criminal cases , whichmust be beyond any reasonable doubts . xxmaj the xxmaj tribunal appliedthe correct test in the analysis of the evidence before it . xxmaj notably , the xxmaj high xxmaj court has not doubted the evidence of xxup pw \\ xxunk being unreliable nor has it discarded his version that thedriver of the xxmaj maruti xxmaj car could not spot the parked xxmaj gas xxmaj xxunk to the flash lights of the oncoming traffic from the xxunk . xxmaj further , the xxmaj tribunal also adverted to the xxunk against the driver of the xxmaj gas xxmaj tanker of xxunk his vehicle in a negligent manner in the middle of theroad . xxmaj the xxmaj site xxmaj plan ( xxmaj ext . p \\ xad45 ) reinforces the version of xxup pw \\ xxunk the xxmaj truck ( xxmaj gas xxmaj tanker ) was parked in the middle of xxunk but the xxmaj high xxmaj court opined to the contrary withoutassigning any reason whatsoever . xxmaj in our view , the xxmaj site xxunk . p \\ xad45 ) filed along with the charge \\ xadsheet does not supportthe finding recorded by the xxmaj high xxmaj court that the xxmaj gas xxmaj xxunk not parked in the middle of the road . xxmaj notably , the highcourt has also not doubted the claimant ’s plea that the xxunk / offending vehicle was parked without any indicator xxunk lights . xxmaj the fact that xxup pw \\ xad7 who was standing on theopposite side of the road at a distance of about 70 feet , xxunk the xxmaj gas xxmaj tanker parked on the other side of the road doesnot discredit his version that the xxmaj maruti xxmaj car coming from theopposite side could not spot the xxmaj gas xxmaj tanker due to flash xxunk the oncoming traffic from the front side . xxmaj it is not in disputethat the road is a busy road . xxmaj in the cross \\ xadexamination , xxunk any attempt been made to discredit the version of xxup pw \\ xxunk has any suggestion been made that no vehicle with xxunk on was coming from the opposite direction of the xxunk xxmaj tanker at the relevant time
